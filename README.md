(Terra's RDP app)
<br>
Three Major Aspects:<br>
Used to access Terra's EC2 on AWS using mstsc.(simple system calls) <br>
This creates and deletes credentials on Users local device. <br>
Contains the domain name instead of IP address for increased scalability.

Auth.Java is for a tiny Implementation for Authentication using PostgreSQL.Pretty useless here.
